## Prerequisites

- NodeJs (>= 14.17.0)
- NPM (>= 7.18.0)

## Setup

1. Install all packages :

```bash
npm install
```

2. Because this project uses Firebase, you need to [config Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) first. Copy firebase config example and fill it with your configuration (if you don't know how to get your configuration just search on youtube ***how to setup a firebase project***):

```bash
cp src/firebase-config.json src/firebase-config.json
```

## Development

To run this project in your development environment please follow this steps:

1. Run Hardhat network first :

```bash
npx hardhat node
```
Note:If you get output where the JSON-RPC server running on this address ***::1***<br> Please use --hostname argument to set the hardhat to use ipv4
```bash
npx hardhat node --hostname 127.0.0.1
```

2. Open the seconds terminal and run this command below to deploy smart contract on the network :

```bash
npx hardhat run smart-contract/scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

3. Rename .env.example to .env or you can just use cp command :

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Change SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_LOCAL on `.env` based on address returned by the deploy script.<br>
the ***SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_LOCAL*** is basically the account address from hardhat RPC

5. Make sure the terminal **(1)** is still running and then on the other terminal type this command:

```bash
npm start
```
In the end you have 2 terminal 1 for running the hardhat server and other to run the web server

## Available Scripts

### Web App Scripts

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run build`

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm test`

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.

### Smart Contract Scripts

#### `npm run contract:compile`

Compile smart contracts, so they can be used on the web app and smart contract test.

#### `npm run contract:test`

Run test for smart contracts. Make sure `contract-types` folder exists on the project root. If it doesn't exist. Run `npm run contract:compile`.

#### `npm run contract:clean`

Remove all files related to the compile result of smart contracts.

## Deployment

### Web App

If you're using services like Vercel or Netlify. Just use the default configuration for React. Production build command is `npm run build` and the directory is `build`.

If you hosted it yourself. Just run `npm run build` and upload the `build` folder.

### Smart Contract

Here's how to deploy the smart contract. Make sure to change the NETWORK based on your network to deploy, eg. `ropsten`, `localhost`.

```bash
npx hardhat run smart-contract/scripts/deploy.ts --network NETWORK
```

This project uses Ropsten as the test network. So if you like to try using Ropsten too, here's how:

1. Change DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY on `.env` with your account private key.
2. You can use [Infura](https://infura.io) to create an Ethereum node. Infura Ethereum node already includes the Ropsten network.
3. After creating an Ethereum node on Infura, go to `Settings`, change the `ENDPOINTS` selection from `Mainnet` to `Ropsten`. Copy the HTTP URL, that's your Ropsten RPC URL. The URL should look like this: `https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/12345abcde`. You can see that it starts with `ropsten` on the subdomain.
4. Change ROPSTEN_RPC_URL on `.env` with your Ropsten RPC URL.
5. Run the deploy script with `ropsten` as the network. Change SNOWPACK_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ROPSTEN on `.env` based on address returned by the deploy script.
